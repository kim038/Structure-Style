    <p class="caption">The Earth’s land and the ocean serve as natural carbon sinks, absorbing large amounts of
        greenhouse gas
        emissions. Conserving and restoring natural spaces, and the biodiversity they contain, is essential for limiting
        emissions and adapting to climate impacts.</p>
    <div class="one">
        <p>Biological diversity — or biodiversity— is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and
            bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests or coral reefs. The biodiversity we see today is the result of
            4.5 billion years of evolution, increasingly influenced by humans.</p>
        <p>Biodiversity forms the web of life that we depend on for so many things-food, water, medicine, a stable
            climate, economic growth, among others. Over half of global GDP is dependent on nature. More than 1 billion
            people rely on forests for their livelihoods. And land and the ocean absorb more than half of all carbon
            emissions.</p>
        <p> But nature is in crisis. Up to one million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades.
            irreplaceable ecosystems like parts of the Amazon rainforest are turning from carbon sink into carbon
            sources due to deforestation. And 85 percent of wetlands, such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps which
            absorb large amounts of carbon, have disappeared.</p>

                so the carbon doesn’t oxidize and float off into the atmosphere. </p>

        <h2>Is the UN tackling climate change and biodiversity altogether?</h2>
        <p>Governments deal with climate change and biodiversity through two different international agreements – the UN
            Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), both
            established at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit.</p>
        <p>Similar to the historic Paris Agreement made in 2015 under the UNFCCC, parties to the Biodiversity Convention
            in December 2022 adopted an agreement for nature, known as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity
            Framework, which succeeds the Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted in 2010.</p>
        <p>The framework includes wide-ranging steps to tackle the causes of biodiversity loss worldwide, including
            climate change and pollution.
            “An ambitious and effective post-2020 global biodiversity framework, with clear targets and benchmarks, can
            put nature and people back on track,” the UN Secretary-General said, adding that, “this framework should
            work in synergy with the Paris Agreement on climate change and other multilateral agreements on forests,
            desertification and oceans.”</p>
        <p>In December 2022, governments met in Montreal, Canada to agree on the new framework to secure an ambitious
            and transformative global plan to set humanity on a path to living in harmony with nature.
            “Delivering on the framework will contribute to the climate agenda, while full delivery of the Paris
            Agreement is needed to allow the framework to succeed,” said Inger Andersen, the head of the UN Environment
            Programme. “We can’t work in isolation if we are to end the triple planetary crises.”
