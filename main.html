    <p class="caption">The Earth’s land and the ocean serve as natural carbon sinks, absorbing large amounts of
        greenhouse gas
        emissions. Conserving and restoring natural spaces, and the biodiversity they contain, is essential for limiting
        emissions and adapting to climate impacts.</p>

        <p>Biological diversity — or biodiversity— is the variety of life on Earth, in all its forms, from genes and
            bacteria to entire ecosystems such as forests or coral reefs. The biodiversity we see today is the result of
            4.5 billion years of evolution, increasingly influenced by humans.</p>
        <p>Biodiversity forms the web of life that we depend on for so many things-food, water, medicine, a stable
            climate, economic growth, among others. Over half of global GDP is dependent on nature. More than 1 billion
            people rely on forests for their livelihoods. And land and the ocean absorb more than half of all carbon
            emissions.</p>
        <p> But nature is in crisis. Up to one million species are threatened with extinction, many within decades.
            irreplaceable ecosystems like parts of the Amazon rainforest are turning from carbon sink into carbon
            sources due to deforestation. And 85 percent of wetlands, such as salt marshes and mangrove swamps which
            absorb large amounts of carbon, have disappeared.</p>

        <h2>Why is biodiversity essential for limiting climate change?</h2>
        <p>When human activities produce greenhouse gases, around half of all emissions remain in the atmosphere, while
            the other half is absorbed by the land and ocean. These ecosystems - and the biodiversity they contain - are
            natural carbon sinks, providing so-called nature-based solutions to climate change.</p>

            <p>Peatlands – wetlands such as marshes and swamps – cover only 3 per cent of the world’s land, but they
                store twice as much carbon as all the forests. Preserving and restoring peatlands means keeping them wet
                so the carbon doesn’t oxidize and float off into the atmosphere. </p>

            <p>Protecting, managing, and restoring forests, for example, offers roughly 2/3 of the total mitigation
                potential of all nature-based solutions. Despite massive and ongoing losses, forests still cover more
                than 30 per cent of the planet’s land.</p>
